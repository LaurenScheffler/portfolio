        <p>Design is a powerful concept that businesses utilize throughout marketing materials. Whether it is in regards to color palettes, shapes, or even website development, design plays a key factor in the decision-making process of building a business's brand. </p>

        <p>I have helped businesses make these vital choices to create a well-rounded brand for themselves online. Putting meaning behind design choices regarding your business helps create a recognizable image for consumers to remember. </p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 20pt;">Content</h2>

        <p>Content is a driving force for your audience. What does your business share on its website or social media pages that draw your audience in? Marketing is more than just advertising, it is understanding what content your audience is more likely to view. Content can refer to articles both online or in print, Instagram reels, YouTube videos, email campaigns, and more. </p>

        <p>I have created, edited, and managed content creation for roughly 2 years for both web and print formats. I learned during this time how crucial it is to conduct research before creating something to post online. This research helps you understand your target audience and helps that grow exponentially over time. </p>

        <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is a marketing practice that businesses execute online to help them rank higher in internet searches in relation to their niche. Businesses can resort to paying for sponsored results or organically reaching these results by using particular verbiage on their website and online presence to help drive more traffic and potential revenue their way. Since many individuals access search engines in their daily lives, many businesses can and do profit off of ranking high with search terms. </p>
    
        <p>I have roughly 2 years of experience creating content with the ultimate goal of ranking higher in online searches for entertainment in Orlando. As a large city in America, Orlando has so many unique experiences that wide audiences are constantly looking for. Plus, it helps that Orlando is the Theme Park Capital of the World. </p>
